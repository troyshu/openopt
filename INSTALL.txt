Check webpage

Installation (very briefly, link above leads to more precize):

1. Ensure you have Python (v >= 2.5 is recommended), numpy (v >= 1.1.0 is recommended) and setuptools installed.
You can use Linux software channels, like this for Debian/*UBUNTU:
[sudo] aptitude install python-numpy
[sudo] aptitude install python-setuptools
(Linux OSes already have Python installed)

# optional, for graphics output:
[sudo] aptitude install python-matplotlib

# optional packages that may be present in software channels: 
# python-scipy, python-cvxopt, some others

All optional packages and/or solvers could be installed after OO installation, when they will be required for the tasks involved.

2. 
[sudo] python setup.py install
or 
[sudo] python setup.py develop

3. To check installation you could try running "python nlp_1.py" from /examples directory
